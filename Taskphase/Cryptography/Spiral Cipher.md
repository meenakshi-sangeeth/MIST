`cipher:taskphaWL_PL4sOingpYefdngaP{_diddL40ap}y5rn_s1m37`

Spiral cipher is a way of writing a message in a grid (matrix), filling it in a spiral pattern (usually clockwise) instead of left-to-right. The cipher text is then read row by row (or in some defined order).
To decrypt a spiral cipher, you need to make a square grid and fill the cipher text row by row. Then read it out in spiral order (reverse of encryption) to get the original message

For the given ciphertext, I used an online decoder

Thus, the plaintext is `taskphase{4r73m1s_n0_fOWL_PL4YPL5y}paddingpadding`
